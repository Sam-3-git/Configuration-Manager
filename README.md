Script used to perform creation, modification, and removal of Software Update Groups. Contains a user-driven menu to allow a more user-friendly experience.

### Parameters

- **SiteCode**
  - ConfigMan Site Code
- **ProviderMachineName**
  - ConfigMan Site Server FQDN

## Create CM Collection Enviorment <a name = "create-cm-collection-environment"></a>
[Create-CMCollectionEnviorment](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/tree/main/Scripts/Create-CMCollectionEnviorment)

This script is designed to create device collections and organize them into structured folders. It will create a collection, inject a query if needed, and move the collection to the appropriate folder. Collections are built based on criteria specified in the `Create-CMCollectionEnvironment.csv` file.

### Installation Guide

1. Download the necessary scripts and files:
   - [Create-CMCollectionEnviorment.csv](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/blob/main/Scripts/Create-CMCollectionEnviorment/Create-CMCollectionEnviorment.csv)
   - [Create-CMCollectionEnviorment.ps1](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/blob/main/Scripts/Create-CMCollectionEnviorment/Create-CMCollectionEnviorment.ps1)

3. Run the script with the appropriate parameters:
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions (Full Administrator role in SCCM).
   - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files.
   
```powershell
.\CCM_LocalAdminGroupSetup.ps1 -SiteCode <YourSiteCode> -ProviderMachineName <YourProviderMachineName>
```

### Notes
- Ensure that `Create-CMCollectionEnviorment.csv` is in the same root directory as the script.
- If in a CAS environment, run this script at the CAS level.
- An update to membership collection may be required after creation.
- A reload to the console will be necessary for new device collection folders to be viewed.
- Additional Hardware Inventory classes are required in the default settings.
    - Installed Software - Asset Intelligence (SMS_InstalledSoftware) 
    - Software Licensing Product - Asset Intelligence (SoftwareLicensingProduct)
    - Client Diagnostics (CCM_ClientDiagnostics)

## Create CCM_LocalAdminGroupDetails WMI Class <a name = "create-ccm_localadmingroupdetails-wmi-class"></a>
[CCM_LocalAdminGroup](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/tree/main/Scripts/CCM_LocalAdminGroup)

This script is designed to create a new WMI class, `CCM_LocalAdminGroupDetails`. The `CCM_LocalAdminGroup.ps1` script is executed as a compliance item. The `CCM_LocalAdminGroupSetup.ps1` script imports both `CCM_LocalAdminGroupDetails.cab` and `CCM_LocalAdminGroup.mof` into the compliance baseline section and the default client setting's hardware inventory classes, respectively.

By default, the compliance baseline deploys to `All Desktop and Server Clients`. You can change the deployment to a desired collection by using the `-CMDeviceCollectionName` parameter when running `CCM_LocalAdminGroupSetup.ps1`.

This script inventories details of the local administrator group on the targeted collections. The following properties are inventoried:

- Account Name
- Domain
- Object Class (User or Group)
- Password Last Set Date
- Principal Source (Active Directory or Local)
- Account Enabled
- SID

The instance of the class can then be queried using the Resource Explorer. Collection queries can be created based on the `CCM_LocalAdminGroupDetails` properties using WQL.

### Installation Guide

1. Download the zip file containing the necessary scripts and files:
   - [CCM_LocalAdminGroup.zip](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/blob/main/Scripts/CCM_LocalAdminGroup/CCM_LocalAdminGroup.zip)

2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a desired location:

```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path .\CCM_LocalAdminGroup.zip -DestinationPath C:\desired\location
```
3. Run the script with the appropriate parameters:
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions (Full Administrator role in SCCM).
   - Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
   
```powershell
.\CCM_LocalAdminGroupSetup.ps1 -SiteCode <YourSiteCode> -ProviderMachineName <YourProviderMachineName> -CMDeviceCollectionName <YourCMDeviceCollectionName>
```
### Notes
- Ensure that `CCM_LocalAdminGroup.mof` and `CCM_LocalAdminGroupDetails.cab` are in the same root directory as the script.
- If in a CAS environment, run this script at the CAS and not the primary site.

# Functions <a name = "functions"></a>
---
Various [Functions](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/tree/main/Functions) used for quick ConfigMan tasks.

[Sort-CMDrivers](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/blob/main/Functions/Sort-CMDrivers)

This PowerShell function organizes Configuration Manager (CM) drivers based on a specified criterion (`$SortBy`). It creates folders under the `Driver` parent folder using `$SortBy` as the folder name, then moves CM objects into these folders according to the sorting criteria. Finally, it prompts the user to reload the CM console to view the changes.
```powershell
    .EXAMPLE
        # Sort a single driver
        Get-CMDriver -Name "Intel(R) Precise Touch Device" -Fast | Sort-CMDrivers -SortBy "Touch Drivers"
   
    .EXAMPLE
        # Sort by user citeria
        Get-CMDriver -Fast | Where-Object {$_.DriverProvider -eq "Microsoft"} | Sort-CMDrivers -SortBy "Microsoft"

    .EXAMPLE
        # Sort all drivers by class
        Get-CMDriver -Fast | Select-Object -ExpandProperty DriverClass -Unique | ForEach-Object -Process {Get-CMDriver -Fast | Where-Object -Property DriverClass -EQ $_ | Sort-CMDrivers -SortBy $_}
```

[Write-Log](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/blob/main/Functions/Write-Log)

This PowerShell function is designed to write logs that are easily interperted by `CMTrace.exe`.
```powershell
    .EXAMPLE
    Write-Log -Message "Info: This is the start of the log" -Severity 1 -Component "BEGIN"

    .EXAMPLE
    Write-Log -Message "Warning: This is a warning in the middle of the log" -Severity 2 -Component "PROCESS"

    .EXAMPLE
    Write-Log -Message "Error: This is a terminiating error for some process... $SomeProcessPassedExitCode" -Severity 3 -Component "END"
```

[ConvertTo-CMBoundryIPSubnet](https://github.com/Sam-3-git/Configuration-Manager-PS/blob/main/Functions/ConvertTo-CMBoundryIPSubnet)

This PowerShell function creates site boundries based off Active Directory Sites and Services. Uses a combination of Site Name properties and subnet values to create boundries that are easily identified. Does not work with ipv6 subnets. Function is designed to take input from `Get-ADReplicationSubnet`.
```powershell
    .EXAMPLE
    Get-ADReplicationSubnet -Filter * | ConvertTo-CMBoundryIPSubnet
```
